**Project Title: Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression**

**Project Overview:**

This project focuses on developing a predictive model for diagnosing diabetes using a logistic regression approach. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle and originally provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, is tailored for the specific purpose of diagnostically forecasting diabetes in patients. Notably, the dataset exclusively comprises female patients, at least 21 years of age, and of Pima Indian heritage.

**Dataset Details:**

The dataset, retrieved from Kaggle, consists of various variables, some of which serve as independent factors (comprising several medical predictor variables), while one variable stands as the dependent target variable denoted as 'Outcome'. The dataset was meticulously selected to encompass solely female patients of at least 21 years of age, all belonging to the Pima Indian heritage.

**Objective:**

The primary objective is to leverage the diagnostic measurements provided in the dataset to create a reliable predictive model capable of discerning the presence or absence of diabetes in the target population.

**Methodology:**

The logistic regression model will be employed as the primary analytical tool. Logistic regression is chosen for its effectiveness in binary classification tasks.
